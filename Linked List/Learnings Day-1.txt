- Started learning linked list from scratch.
- Learned the basic theory and solved 3 problems.

- A linked list is a linear data structure
- In linked list, elements are not stored in continous manner

- Why we prefer linked list over arrays
 > Dynamic nature in respect of size
 > Doing operations like updation/insertion/deletion are easy in linked list
 
 - Also there are some drawbacks of linked list
   >  Random access is not allowed. 
   >  Extra memory space for a pointer is required.
   
   
   Apart from this
   endl - Inserts a new line and flushes the stream
   /n   - Only inserts a new line.
