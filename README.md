## Linked List
- A linked list is a linear data structure
- In linked list, elements are not stored in continous manner
- The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers 

## Types of Linked List
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List

## Why we prefer linked list over arrays
 - Dynamic nature in respect of size
 - Doing operations like updation/insertion/deletion are easy in linked list
 
## Drawbacks of linked list
   -  Random access is not allowed. 
   -  Extra memory space for a pointer is required.
   
## Initialization of linked list
     struct node
     {
       int data;
       struct node *next;
     };
## Some brief about linked list
   - Linked list is made of nodes connected to each other
   - And <b>Nodes</b> consists of two blocks namely
     - <b>Data</b>
     - <b>Pointer</b>(also called 'next' while programming) 
   - Data refers to the value at the data block of node
   - Pointer points to the next node in order to link every node with each other
   
## Did three basic questions based on linked list on GFG
  - Count Node Of Linked List
  - Linked List Length Even or Odd
  - Reverse a Linked List

# Day 2ðŸš€

  ## Learned the basics of linked list
   - learned the opertions performed on linked list <b>insertion</b>/<b>deletion</b>/<b>updation</b>
  ## Did three questions on GFG
   - Print linked list elements
   - Delete alternate node
   - Check if circular linked list

# Day 3ðŸš€

  ## Linked list start from creating the linked list to operations performed on linked list(Singly Linked List)
   - Creating Linked List
   - Displaying Linked List
   
   ## Learned the operations performed in linked list
   
   ### Insertion
   - Insertion at first
   - Insertion at last
   - Insertion in between
     
   ### Deletion
   - Deletion at first
   - Deletion at last
   - Deletion in between
   
   ### Others
   - Count nodes
   - Remove duplicates
   
# Day 4ðŸš€

## Started learning some algorithm
  ## Euclid Algo
    - A basic funda to find the GCD
  
  ## Extended Euclid Algo
      -Extended Euclidean algorithm also finds integer coefficients x and y 
  
## Practiced some questions based on the algorithm
  - Will practice some more questions in order to grasp the concept totally
  
  
# Day 5ðŸš€

## Started learning some algorithm
  ## Sieve of Eratosthenes
     - The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n when n is smaller than 10 million
