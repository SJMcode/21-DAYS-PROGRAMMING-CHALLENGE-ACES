## Linked List
- A linked list is a linear data structure
- In linked list, elements are not stored in continous manner
- The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers 

## Types of Linked List
    - Singly Linked List
    - Doubly Linked List
    - Circular Linked List

## Why we prefer linked list over arrays
 - Dynamic nature in respect of size
 - Doing operations like updation/insertion/deletion are easy in linked list
 
## Drawbacks of linked list
   -  Random access is not allowed. 
   -  Extra memory space for a pointer is required.
   
## The initialization of linked list
     struct node
     {
       int data;
       struct node *next;
     };
## Some brief about linked list
   - Linked list is made of nodes connected to each other
   - And "Nodes" consists of two blocks namely
     - Data
     - Pointer(also called 'next' while programming 
   - Data refers to the value at the data block of node
   - Pointer points to the next node in order to link every node with each other
   
## Did three basic questions based on linked list on GFG
  - Count Node Of Linked List
  - Linked List Length Even or Odd
  - Reverse a Linked List

# Day 2ðŸš€

  ## Learned the basics of linked list
   - learned the opertions performed on linked list insertion/deletion/updation and practice all by performing the codes
   
  ## Did three questions on GFG
   - Print linked list elements
   - Delete alternate node
   - Check if circular linked list
