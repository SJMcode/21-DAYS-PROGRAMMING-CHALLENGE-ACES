- Given a number n, print all primes smaller than or equal to n. 
- It is also given that n is a small number.
- The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n when n is smaller than 10 million

Working of Algorithm
- Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, â€¦, n).
- Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
- Starting from p2, count up in increments of p and mark each of these numbers greater than or equal to p2 itself in the list.
  These numbers will be p(p+1), p(p+2), p(p+3), etc..
- Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked.
If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
