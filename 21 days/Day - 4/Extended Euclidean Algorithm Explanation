Extended Euclidean algorithm also finds integer coefficients x and y such that - 
 ax + by = gcd(a, b) 
 
 Let's say for an example
 
 Input: a = 30, b = 20
Output: gcd = 10
        x = 1, y = -1
(30*1 + 20*(-1) = 10)

Input: a = 35, b = 15
Output: gcd = 5
        x = 1, y = -2
(35*1 + 15*(-2) = 5)
